            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Intelligence is an important factor in how the individual responds to
                education. Those who have higher scores of intelligence-metrics tend to perform better at school and go
                on to higher levels of education.[60] This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that
                education increases measurable intelligence.[61] Studies have shown that while educational attainment is
                important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to
                intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot
                of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to
                teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as
                possible.[citation needed] Finnish schools have begun to move away from the regular subject-focused
                curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study
                concepts like climate change instead.[100] There are also active educational interventions to implement
                programs and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as first generation students.
